  # Create New Simone Prompt

  **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!

  **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these 7 items:

  1. Gather prompt requirements
  2. Analyze prompt purpose
  3. Define TODO structure
  4. Create detailed sections
  5. Add conditional logic
  6. Define output format
  7. Generate and save prompt

  ## 1 · Gather prompt requirements

  {{#if prompt_name}}
  Creating prompt: "{{prompt_name}}"
  {{else}}
  Ask the user: "What prompt do you want to create? Use underscores (e.g., 'review_code', 'deploy_app')"
  {{/if}}

  **CRITICAL:** Interview the user to understand:
  - What is the main purpose of this prompt?
  - What are the key steps? (aim for 5-9 main actions)
  - What information needs to be gathered from the user?
  - What should the output look like?
  - Are there risk-level based behaviors?
  - What could go wrong and how should it be handled?

  ## 2 · Analyze prompt purpose

  Based on user input, determine:
  - **Action verb**: CREATE, REVIEW, ANALYZE, UPDATE, etc.
  - **Target object**: issue, code, project, commit, etc.
  - **Required context**: What project info is needed?
  - **Dependencies**: Other prompts or tools required?

  ## 3 · Define TODO structure

  Create a numbered list of 5-9 high-level steps that:
  1. Start with gathering/validating input
  2. Include necessary research/analysis
  3. Cover the main action
  4. Include verification/quality checks
  5. End with structured output

  **VERIFICATION:** Each TODO item must be:
  - A single, clear action
  - Independently verifiable as complete
  - Essential to the prompt's purpose

  ## 4 · Create detailed sections

  For each TODO item, write a detailed section following this pattern:

  ```
  ## N · [Action verb + specific task]

  [Clear, imperative instructions]

  {{#if (conditional logic needed)}}
  Risk-based behavior:
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  - [Careful mode action]
  {{else if (lte project.riskLevel 7)}}
  - [Balanced mode action]  
  {{else}}
  - [YOLO mode action]
  {{/if}}
  {{/if}}

  [Specific steps with file paths, commands, or API calls]
  ```

  ## 5 · Add conditional logic

  Identify where behavior should change based on:
  - **Risk level**: Use comparison helpers (lt, lte, gt, gte)
  - **Project type**: Use context length or specific flags
  - **Available tools**: Use feature helpers for optional capabilities

  Example patterns:
  ```handlebars
  {{#if (lt project.riskLevel 5)}}
  Ask user: "Should I proceed with [action]?"
  {{else}}
  Proceed with [action] and report results
  {{/if}}
  ```

  ## 6 · Define output format

  Every prompt MUST end with:

  ```
  ✅ **Result**: [What was accomplished]

  🔎 **Scope**: [Specific items affected]

  💬 **Summary**: [One paragraph explanation]

  ⏭️ **Next steps**: 
  - Use `/prompt_name` to [follow-up action]
  - [Other recommended actions]
  ```

  ## 7 · Generate and save prompt

  Create the complete prompt YAML:

  ```yaml
  name: {{prompt_name}}
  description: [Clear, concise description]
  arguments:
    - name: [optional_arg]
      description: [What this argument provides]
      required: false
  template: |
    # [Action Verb] [Object]
    
    **IMPORTANT:** Follow from Top to Bottom - don't skip anything!
    
    **CREATE A TODO LIST** with exactly these [N] items:
    
    1. [First step]
    2. [Second step]
    ...
    N. [Final step]
    
    [Detailed sections for each TODO item]
    
    [Standard output format]
  ```

  Save to: `.simone/prompts/{{prompt_name}}.yaml`

  ✅ **Result**: Prompt "{{prompt_name}}" created successfully

  🔎 **Scope**: New prompt following Simone style guide

  💬 **Summary**: Generated a structured prompt with {{number_of_steps}} main steps, proper conditional logic for risk levels, and standard output format. The prompt follows all style guide requirements including TODO structure, imperative voice, and interview-style input gathering.

  ⏭️ **Next steps**: 
  - Test the prompt with `/simone:{{prompt_name}}`
  - Review generated YAML for completeness
  - Add to prompt documentation
